From my talk at [RubyConf Colombia 2019](https://www.rubyconf.co/) "Programming Salsa" here are the [slides](/documents/programming_salsa.pdf)

The source code for the song is [here](https://github.com/itsWill/salsa)

The instrument/software/library/IDE we used to code up the song was [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)

The tracklist was:

* Los Campeones de La Salsa -- Willie Chirino (Introduction)
* Abre Que Yo Voy -- Miguel Enriquez (The Clave)
* Pedro Navaja -- Ruben Blades (The Tumbao)
* Vente Pa Ca -- Ricky Martin and Maluma (The latin pop version and the salsa version)
* Azafata -- Johny Vazquez (Didn't play this in the presentation but was to showcase the sound of the cencerro i.e. the cowbell)
* Diablo Rojo -- Rodrigo Y Gabriela feat. C.U.B.A

There are other songs I wanted to show:

Adios Amor by Daniela Darcourt.  This one is useful to contrast with the original Cristian Nodal version.

Mosaico 1920 - Johnny Ventura Y Su Combo. There's a great part towards the end where each instrument is called out and goes into an individual solo. Great to hear the specific instruments. This song can, and should, be enjoyed with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-NpwnGBHWk).

Oiga Mire Vea - Guayacan Orquesta. Just a wonderful song that I wanted to use to highlight the importance of Cali in Salsa.

I'd suggest the following resources too dig deeper:

* Spinning Mambo Into Salsa: Caribbean Dance in Global Commerce By Juliet E. McMains

This book was handsdown the best resource for tracing the origins of Salsa music. It doesn't have much about Salsa's origin predating the 1950's, but I haven't found a good resource there yet, this one keeps being one of the best researched and argued books out there however on modern Salsa.

* Godfried Toussaint's articles [The Rhythm that Conquered the World: What Makes a “Good” Rhythm Good?](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/Percussive-Notes-Web.pdf) and [A Mathematical Analysis of African, Brazilian and Cuban Clave Rhythms](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/clave.pdf)

I didn't get a chance to go into these Computer Science papers but they are a beutiful analysis of the mathematical properties of the Clave rhythm that is also approachable to boot.
